Hi! I am a Rushikesh Jadhav let me walk you through my intro, projects and blogs.

### Introduction

I am a student of B-tech 3rd year. I love to learn new technology and work on them. I started studying  HTML-CSS because I got a free-course but as I started coding for Front-end that thing became an addiction.I am also good at Javascript .

## Why are you taking this challenge

I need an internship in December 2020 and I want to learn more about the react and react-native and their frameworks like gatsby, next js, electron, and expo, I also want to learn about node js, databases, graphql so I can be a full stack developer in future.

## Something interesting about you

I love to participate in debate and also group discussions as my softskills abilities are pretty good . I am also a Poet ,  Jr.Radio-Jockey and I not only write technical blogs  but also novels . Strong believer of “Television is an  educating box. Every time somebody turns on the set, I go into the other room and read a book.” 

### Help I need

It would be great if someone tells me how I get started with the competitive programming !
